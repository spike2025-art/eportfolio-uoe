          <h1>Task 4B: Linear Regression</h1>
        </header>

        <p>This task applies linear regression to model the relationship between the average population and GDP per capita of countries from 2001 to 2020. We used Scikit-learn to compute the regression line and evaluate the fit.</p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The linear regression model resulted in a coefficient (slope) of approximately <strong>0.000017</strong> and an intercept around <strong>10,514</strong>, indicating that for each additional person in a country's population, the GDP per capita increases slightly—although the effect is minimal.</li>
  <li>The model's <strong>R² score was ~0.38</strong>, suggesting that the linear model explains around 38% of the variance in GDP per capita based on population. This indicates that the model has <strong>limited explanatory power</strong> and is likely underfitting the data.</li>
  <li>The scatter plot with the regression line shows a wide dispersion of data points around the regression line, reinforcing that the linear relationship is weak.</li>
  <li>This result emphasizes that while population is a relevant feature, it should not be used in isolation to predict GDP per capita. Incorporating additional variables—such as education level, resource availability, and government expenditure—would enhance the model.</li>
</ul>


        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p><strong>What?</strong> I performed linear regression using population as a predictor for GDP per capita.</p>
        <p><strong>So What?</strong> The linear model provided a simple but effective way to estimate GDP outcomes based on population size.</p>
        <p><strong>What Next?</strong> I will explore using additional socioeconomic variables and regularization for improved model accuracy.</p>
