          <h1>Task 4B: Linear Regression</h1>
        </header>

        <p>This task applies linear regression to model the relationship between the average population and GDP per capita of countries from 2001 to 2020. We used Scikit-learn to compute the regression line and evaluate the fit.</p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
<p>The Pearson correlation coefficient quantifies the strength of the linear relationship between population and GDP per capita. A strong or weak relationship can be visually interpreted via the plotted scatter diagram.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Pearson Correlation Coefficient was calculated to be approximately <strong>0.62</strong>, suggesting a <strong>moderate positive correlation</strong> between a country's average population and its average GDP per capita (2001â€“2020).</li>
  <li>While there is a positive trend, the strength of the correlation is not strong. This indicates that while population size may influence GDP per capita, it is not the only or dominant factor.</li>
  <li>The scatter plot reveals that countries with smaller populations tend to have a wider spread of GDP per capita, including some very high-income nations (e.g., Luxembourg, Norway), while heavily populated countries tend to cluster in the mid-to-low GDP range.</li>
  <li>The result highlights the importance of considering additional factors such as industrialization, economic policy, education, and governance when interpreting development metrics.</li>
</ul>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p><strong>What?</strong> I performed linear regression using population as a predictor for GDP per capita.</p>
        <p><strong>So What?</strong> The linear model provided a simple but effective way to estimate GDP outcomes based on population size.</p>
        <p><strong>What Next?</strong> I will explore using additional socioeconomic variables and regularization for improved model accuracy.</p>
