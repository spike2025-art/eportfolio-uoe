        <p>This reflection summarises key professional and technical insights gained through the Unit 3 activities on correlation and regression analysis.</p>

        <h3> Legal, Social, Ethical, and Professional Issues</h3>
        <p>The machine learning professionals, should be responsible not only for building technically accurate models but also for ensuring they are used ethically. This includes protecting data privacy, mitigating algorithmic bias, maintaining transparency, and considering the societal impact of our models. In this unit, I reflected on how these statistical models can generate inequality if not carefully monitored, and the role of explainability in maintaining trust.</p>

        <h3> Applicability & Dataset Challenges</h3>
        <p>Machine learning models are only as reliable as the data they are trained on. In this unit, I learned how issues such as missing values, outliers, and multicollinearity can distort regression outputs. The structure and quality of a dataset drive the choice of regression technique. Real-world data often requires preprocessing and thoughtful feature selection to yield meaningful insights. Understanding these challenges is essential for effective ML practice.</p>

        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The activities in this unit helped me grow both as a technical practitioner and as a responsible AI professional, with a deeper appreciation for data ethics and real-world model deployment challenges.</p>
