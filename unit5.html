          <h1>Unit 5: Jaccard Coefficient - Patient Similarity</h1>
        </header>

        <p>This task involved calculating the <strong>Jaccard similarity coefficient</strong> to compare patients' binary medical test data. Values such as <code>Y</code> and <code>P</code> were treated as 1 (positive), while <code>N</code> and <code>A</code> were treated as 0 (negative).</p>

        <h3>ðŸ“„ Description</h3>
        <p>We were provided a small dataset of three patients with mixed categorical test results. The task involved converting all test values to binary form and calculating pairwise Jaccard similarity:</p>
        <pre>
Y & P â†’ 1
N & A â†’ 0
        </pre>

        <h3> Jaccard Results</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Jack & Mary:</strong> 0.33</li>
          <li><strong>Jack & Jim:</strong> 0.67</li>
          <li><strong>Jim & Mary:</strong> 0.75</li>
        </ul>

       <h3> Reflection</h3>
<p><strong>What?</strong> In this task, I used the Jaccard coefficient to measure the similarity between individuals based on binary representations of categorical test outcomes. This metric is particularly effective when we want to focus on shared positive attributes while ignoring the negative matches.</p>

<p><strong>So What?</strong> The Jaccard similarity coefficient goes far beyond healthcare applications. In <strong>Financial Risk Management</strong>, it can be used to compare customer behavior profiles â€” for example, identifying groups of clients who share similar repayment patterns, product subscriptions, or transaction histories. It's especially useful for sparse binary datasets, such as flag indicators for fraud, defaults, or compliance violations.</p>

<p><strong>What Next?</strong> I plan to apply Jaccard similarity in risk modeling pipelines for credit scoring, fraud detection, and compliance analytics. It will be particularly valuable when grouping or clustering binary feature profiles, or in building recommender systems for financial services based on shared behavior patterns.</p>
