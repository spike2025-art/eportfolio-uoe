  <h2>Unit 3: Correlation and Regression Activity</h2>

  <p>
    This task involved running a series of four Jupyter notebooks using either a local installation (via the Essex Software Hub) or Google Colab.
    The objective was to explore how changes in dataset variables affect correlation and regression results.
  </p>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <p>
    Run all four of these programs and change variables as needed to observe how the change in data points impacts correlation and regression outcomes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="covariance_pearson_correlation.ipynb" download>covariance_pearson_correlation.ipynb</a></li>
    <li><a href="linear_regression.ipynb" download>linear_regression.ipynb</a></li>
    <li><a href="multiple_linear_regression.ipynb" download>multiple_linear_regression.ipynb</a></li>
    <li><a href="polynomial_regression.ipynb" download>polynomial_regression.ipynb</a></li>
    <li><a href="cars.csv" download>cars.csv</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You are expected to experiment by modifying input variables (e.g., dataset size, noise levels, feature selection) and observing how these affect:
    <ul>
      <li>Pearson correlation coefficient</li>
      <li>Regression accuracy (e.g., RÂ² score)</li>
      <li>Model behavior (overfitting, underfitting)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Articulate the legal, social, ethical and professional issues faced by machine learning professionals.</li>
    <li>Understand the applicability and challenges associated with different datasets for the use of machine learning algorithms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Next Steps</h3>
  <p>
    In the next stage, I will reflect on my observations and include annotated code snippets for each notebook, along with critical commentary
    and ethical/professional implications discovered during this analysis.
