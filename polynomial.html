        <h3>ðŸ“„ Description</h3>
        <p>The goal of this task is to fit a polynomial model (degree 2) between <code>Engine Volume</code> and <code>COâ‚‚ emissions</code> using the cars.csv dataset. This allows the model to capture nonlinear curvature in the relationship that linear regression could not.</p>

        <h3> Code Snapshot</h3>
<pre><code># Transform to polynomial features
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures

poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X_train)

# Fit the regression model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_poly, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
y_pred = model.predict(poly.transform(X_test))
print("RÂ² Score:", r2_score(y_test, y_pred))
</code></pre>

        <h3> Results</h3>

<p>The polynomial regression model (degree 2) demonstrated a significantly improved fit compared to the linear model, especially in capturing curvature in the relationship between <code>Engine Volume</code> and <code>COâ‚‚ Emissions</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>RÂ² Score:</strong> Achieved values typically between <code>0.65</code> and <code>0.75</code>, depending on the train/test split. This indicates a stronger ability to explain variance in the data.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Fit:</strong> The regression curve closely tracked the actual emission patterns, particularly for small to mid-sized engines. The linear model previously underfitted this area.</li>
  <li><strong>Residuals:</strong> Visual inspection showed more uniformly distributed residuals, suggesting the polynomial model better captured systematic variance.</li>
  <li><strong>Variance:</strong> At higher engine volumes, COâ‚‚ emissions varied more widely, which the polynomial model was able to follow more flexibly than a straight line.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> The polynomial regression captured a non-linear trend that a linear model could not. This makes it especially useful for datasets where the relationship between features and target is not strictly linear.</p>

<p>An increased polynomial degree can lead to <em>overfitting</em> â€” where the model fits the training data very well but generalizes poorly to new data.</p>

        <h3> Reflection</h3>
        <p><strong>What?</strong> Applied polynomial regression to better capture non-linear behavior between variables.</p>
        <p><strong>So What?</strong> This method outperformed linear regression for engine volume prediction and visually demonstrated the limits of linear modeling.</p>
        <p><strong>What Next?</strong> Experiment with higher-degree polynomials and regularization (e.g. Ridge/Lasso) to fine-tune performance and avoid overfitting.</p>
