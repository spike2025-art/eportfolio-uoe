          <h1>Task 4A: Correlation</h1>
        </header>

        <p>This task explores the correlation between average population and GDP per capita across countries from 2001 to 2020 using cleaned global datasets. The Pearson correlation coefficient helps quantify the linear relationship between the two variables.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>
<p>The Pearson correlation coefficient quantifies the strength of the linear relationship between population and GDP per capita. A strong or weak relationship can be visually interpreted via the plotted scatter diagram.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Pearson Correlation Coefficient was calculated to be approximately <strong>0.62</strong>, suggesting a <strong>moderate positive correlation</strong> between a country's average population and its average GDP per capita (2001â€“2020).</li>
  <li>While there is a positive trend, the strength of the correlation is not strong. This indicates that while population size may influence GDP per capita, it is not the only or dominant factor.</li>
  <li>The scatter plot reveals that countries with smaller populations tend to have a wider spread of GDP per capita, including some very high-income nations (e.g., Luxembourg, Norway), while heavily populated countries tend to cluster in the mid-to-low GDP range.</li>
  <li>The result highlights the importance of considering additional factors such as industrialization, economic policy, education, and governance when interpreting development metrics.</li>
</ul>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p><strong>What?</strong> I investigated the linear relationship between a country's mean population and its economic output.</p>
        <p><strong>So What?</strong> The correlation analysis revealed whether large populations correlate with higher GDP per capita.</p>
        <p><strong>What Next?</strong> I will incorporate this insight when building models that involve population-related features.</p>
